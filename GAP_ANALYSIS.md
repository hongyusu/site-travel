## ⚠️ Medium Priority Gaps

### 1. **Vendor Booking Management UI** ⚠️

**Issue:** Vendor can see bookings list but lacks advanced management features for better UX and operational efficiency.

**Current Implementation (What Works):** ✅
- ✅ Backend endpoint exists: `GET /bookings/vendor`
- ✅ Basic bookings table in vendor dashboard (`/app/vendor/dashboard/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Displays: Booking Ref, Activity, Customer, Date, Amount, Status, Actions
- ✅ **Approve booking button** (pending → confirmed) - **NEW 2025-10-31**
- ✅ **Reject booking button with reason** (pending → rejected) - **NEW 2025-10-31**
- ✅ **Cancel booking button with reason** (confirmed → cancelled) - **NEW 2025-10-31**
- ✅ Check-in button for confirmed bookings (functional)
- ✅ **Context-aware action buttons based on status** - **NEW 2025-10-31**
- ✅ Status color coding (confirmed=green, pending=yellow, completed=blue)
- ✅ Shows 10 most recent bookings

**Missing Features (Medium Impact):** ❌

1. **Calendar View** (Highest Priority)
   - Currently only table view exists
   - No visual calendar to see bookings by date
   - Would help vendors plan capacity and identify busy periods at a glance
   - Should show bookings on date grid with click-through to details

2. **Booking Details Modal** (High Priority)
   - No detailed view when clicking on a booking row
   - Table shows limited information (only basic fields)
   - Should display full booking information:
     - Complete customer contact information
     - Selected pricing tier (Standard/Premium/VIP) if applicable
     - Time slot selection if applicable
     - Add-ons with quantities if applicable
     - Special requests or notes
     - Itemized payment breakdown
     - Booking history/status changes

3. **Filtering and Search** (Medium Priority)
   - Only shows 10 most recent bookings (hardcoded: `bookings.slice(0, 10)`)
   - No date range filter
   - No status filter (show only confirmed, pending, completed, etc.)
   - No activity filter (important for vendors with multiple activities)
   - No search by customer name or booking reference

4. **Bulk Actions** (Low Priority)
   - No multi-select for check-ins
   - No export to CSV/Excel for reporting
   - No bulk status updates

5. **Pagination** (Low Priority)
   - Limited to 10 bookings display
   - No way to view older bookings beyond the recent 10
   - No "load more" or page navigation

**Impact:** LOW-MEDIUM - Vendors now have functional booking workflow actions (approve/reject/cancel), reducing impact significantly. Remaining features are quality-of-life improvements rather than critical gaps.

**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours (calendar view: 3-4 hours, booking details modal: 1-2 hours)
**Priority:** ⚠️ **LOW-MEDIUM** (downgraded from MEDIUM after workflow actions completion)

**Implementation Order:**
1. Calendar view component (highest ROI)
2. Booking details modal (nice-to-have for additional context)
3. Filtering and pagination (quality of life)
4. Bulk actions (nice-to-have)

## 🟡 Low Priority Gaps

### 3. **Mobile Responsiveness Polish** 🟡

**Issue:** While responsive breakpoints exist, some components need mobile optimization:
- Activity detail page sidebar (booking widget) should become fixed bottom bar on mobile
- Filter sidebar should become bottom sheet modal on mobile
- Review images should support swipe gestures on mobile

**Impact:** LOW - Works but not optimal UX on mobile

**Estimated Time:** 6-8 hours
**Priority:** 🟡 **LOW**

### 4. **Advanced Search Features** 🟡

**Issue:** Some search features from requirements not yet implemented:
- Date picker in search (currently text input)
- Auto-complete for destination search
- Real-time filter count updates ("Show 234 results")

**Impact:** LOW - Basic search works well

**Estimated Time:** 4-5 hours
**Priority:** 🟡 **LOW**
